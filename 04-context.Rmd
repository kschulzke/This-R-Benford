# Context

This Benford's Law analysis is performed in the context of a hypothetical audit of [MicroStrategy Incorporated](https://www.microstrategy.com/) (ticker: [MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR?.tsrc=fin-srch)). At the time this scenario was written, the value of MSTR's [Bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD) holdings – see "Digital Assets" in the balance sheet excerpt below – was higher than MSTR's market capitalization.

In other words, MSTR is basically nothing but Bitcoin. Hence, if Bitcoin is bogus, so is MSTR. Interesting situation for an auditor. No?

Here's the game: Assume that you have been retained by MSTR's auditor, KPMG, to assist their front-end audit risk assessment in preparation for auditing MSTR's financial statements for the year ended 12-31-2023.

KPMG wants you to do a high-level reality check -- using Benford's Law -- on publicly available Bitcoin data. Do the available Bitcoin data suggest a genuine data-generating process? In other words, is the Bitcoin market real, or fake? We might start with the minute-by-minute [Bitcoin data repository on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data/data). You'll need a free Kaggle account to download it.

Assume, hypothetically, that these data cover the 2014-2023 interval. Thus, for purposes of the exercise, the 2021 Bitcoin data are from 2023. Using this data, create an R Notebook (.rmd format) structured around the Five Basic Steps outlined in Exhibit 2-1 of the [AICPA Guide to Audit Data Analytics](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/cpe-learning/publication/guide-to-audit-data-analytics) (ADAs) to perform the analysis and report the results. Here is a summary of the five basic steps:

1.  Plan the ADA

2.  Access and prepare the data

3.  Consider the relevance and reliability of the data

4.  Perform the ADA

5.  Evaluate the results and conclude

We'll focus primarily on steps 2-3, though we won't explicitly identify each step.
