# Context

## MSTR audit

This Benford's Law analysis is performed in the context of a hypothetical audit of [MicroStrategy Incorporated](https://www.microstrategy.com/) (ticker: [MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR?.tsrc=fin-srch)). At the time this scenario was written, the value of MSTR's [Bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD) holdings – see "Digital Assets" in the balance sheet excerpt below – was higher than MSTR's market capitalization.

In other words, MSTR is basically nothing but Bitcoin. Hence, if Bitcoin is bogus, so is MSTR. Interesting situation for an auditor. No?

Here's the game: Assume that you have been retained by MSTR's auditor, KPMG, to assist their front-end audit risk assessment in preparation for auditing MSTR's financial statements for the year ended 12-31-2023.

KPMG wants you to do a high-level reality check -- using Benford's Law -- on publicly available Bitcoin data. Are the Bitcoin data plausible? Do the available Bitcoin data suggest a genuine data-generating process? In other words, is the Bitcoin market real, or fake? We might start with the minute-by-minute [Bitcoin data repository on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data/data). You'll need a free Kaggle account to download it.

Assume, hypothetically, that these data cover the 2014-2023 interval. Thus, for purposes of the exercise, the 2021 Bitcoin data are from 2023. Using this data, create an R Notebook (.rmd format) structured around the Five Basic Steps outlined in Exhibit 2-1 of the [AICPA Guide to Audit Data Analytics](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/cpe-learning/publication/guide-to-audit-data-analytics) (ADAs) to perform the analysis and report the results. Here is a summary of the five basic steps:

1.  Plan the ADA

2.  Access and prepare the data

3.  Consider the relevance and reliability of the data

4.  Perform the ADA

5.  Evaluate the results and conclude

We'll focus primarily on steps 2-3, though we won't explicitly identify each step.

## Benford's Law

The primary ADA chosen for this audit test is a suite of Benford's Law tests instantiated in the R benford.analysis package [@benford.analysis]. Test outputs include statistics, tables, and visualizations. Ancillary ADAs include a "summation test," as well as data validation queries and visualizations executed using SQL and various R packages (e.g., dplyr [@tidyverse], ggplot2 [@ggplot2]).

`Equation 1` p(first two digits = k) = log10(1 + 1/k)

For example, the expected frequency of 41 in first position approximates 0.01046543:

```{r}
log10(1 + 1/41)
```

Given a large enough "sample size" (referred to as "N"), Benford's Law can help in assessing the plausibility of a column of data. The word "sample" is, however, not quite accurate here because Benford's Law is typically applied to the entire set of numbers, not a sample thereof. The expected frequencies of all 89 first-two digit pairs are visualized in the bar chart below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

BfdLaw <- benford.analysis::benford(cars$dist)

BfdLawSub <- data.frame(as.character(BfdLaw$bfd$digits),
                     BfdLaw$bfd$benford.dist)

BfdPlot <- ggplot(BfdLawSub) +   
  geom_bar(aes(as.character.BfdLaw.bfd.digits., BfdLaw.bfd.benford.dist), stat = "identity", fill = "#00CED1", alpha = 0.5) + #https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
   labs(title = "Benford's Law", subtitle = "Predicted relative frequencies of first-digits pairs", y = "Predicted Relative Frequency", x = "First two digits") +
  theme_minimal()+   
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust = 1.5))

BfdPlot

```

Notable departures from Benford's expectations can be, though not always are, a signal of data manipulation or artificial constraints that are part of the data generating process.

Visual assessment of the Benford's Law plots can highlight first-digit sequences for further sampling. However, in most audit situations, it would be impractical to apply tests of details to all observations that begin with a particular pair of digits. Frequently quoted aggregate statistical measures of Benford's Law conformity – like mean absolute deviation or "MAD" – are of limited practical utility [@barney2016], but much can be learned by drilling down into the details [@nigrini2017].
