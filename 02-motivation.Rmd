## I wish I could use R!

Why should accounting professors and professionals learn programming languages like SQL, and R or Python? Why not just stick with GUI[^02-motivation-1] platforms like Excel, Tableau, Idea, Power BI, MS Access, or Alteryx?

[^02-motivation-1]: GUI stands for "Graphical User Interface." Computer or phone apps that acquire user input primarily through "point and click" interaction with graphical images (like icons) are GUI platforms. Excel, Word, Access, and Alteryx are GUIs.

For one thing, data analytics in R – once you get the hang of it – delivers way more endorphins than any GUI ever could. One recent auditing student wrote:

> R Studio, to put it simply, is bad to the freaking bone. I am still trying to figure out many of its capabilities. R Studio is an amazing tool that can and should be used by any company to handle large amounts of data. I've had to use many different types of data software. However, I've never used one as powerful, fast, and capable... If I can just learn how to use it more, I believe I will be able to use it especially well within the charity [where I serve as a board member].

That said, SQL is undeniably the *lingua franca* of relational databases and, therefore, of accounting information systems. As such, it is fair to say that basic fluency in SQL is essential to a complete accounting education. No SQL, no data fluency. No data fluency, no accounting profession. Every financial statement auditor should be able to at least read SQL.

## Speed, Reliability, Agility

But while SQL is necessary for data fluency, it's far from sufficient. SQL is a powerful database management and query machine. Yet, it lacks serious visualization chops and many advanced analytical tools. For these, who do you call? The GUIs, or R and Python? Let's hear from a recent MAcc student, writing at the end of the first week of a Spring semester, after doing a deep dive into R the previous Fall (my emphasis):

> I am very excited to get back into the groove of things and expand my depth of R even further. Being I work at a small firm, I am exposed to several different aspects of accounting: tax, audit, write-up work, etc. Over the past month, I have been working on an ... audit that has required me to dig through boxes of invoices as well as huge spreadsheets. This specific [client] is extremely efficient in their work, but they are “old and set in their ways” and could use many updates in the technology and software department. Last week my manager asked me to take a rather large spreadsheet with payroll data and sort it based on several different factors. I was able to complete the task with no problem; however, *it took a good chunk of time* to complete, and there was *much room for error*. *R scared the daylights out of me at the beginning of the fall semester, but the new [Elsa - name changed!] silently whispered “I wish I could use R for this” when she gave it to me*.

To be fair, "Elsa" was comparing R to Excel. But even so, what would be the point of using SQL if you can use R? In many settings, R and Python offer a better mix of flexibility, agility, speed (in design and execution), data capacity, better audit trail documentation, and lower cost – or some subset thereof – than SQL *or* the GUIs. If the concern is communicating with readers who read only SQL, we'll show how SQL scripts can be seamlessly included in an R Studio document.

GUIs can be easier to learn, but not always. Every Alteryx icon (or collection of icons) represents some R or Python function. Learning Alteryx means learning icons AND the underlying function. Meanwhile, the SQL-R-Python trio require only learning the functions *and* they put full analytical power and flexibility at the analyst's finger tips.

## Deep learning

Just as important as its analytical power, coding grows the mind the coder – it builds mental power. Beyond this, building good code fosters mental discipline and deep knowledge of the data. Coding facilitates intimate understanding of the data, data generating process, and the data model. If accounting is the language of business, coding is the language of data. One auditing analytics student, in the midst of working through this very exercise, commented as follows (my emphasis):

> I learned how to use the My Law principles to evaluate MicroStrategy. After reading the article about My Law, (I won’t lie) I was still confused regarding the concept, but *fortunately, I know how to read R*. What I mean by that is, maybe I didn’t know what exactly what My Law was before our current project, but *since I know what I’m doing in R, I was able to get a grip on the My Law concept by reading my code from the project* ... After doing the code myself, I saw the big picture version of My Law ... I certainly won’t say I’m an expert, but I know it a lot better than I did before this week.

*Got a grip on the concept by reading her code.*

This brings to mind a quote attributed to E.M. Forster and several others:

"How can I know what I think until I hear what I say?"

Coding forces us to learn what we think about the data. This kind of mental weightlifting is good for the mind, the soul, and the accounting profession. Accounting, ultimately, boils down to creating information – in information theory terms, reducing uncertainty or "information entropy." It's not easy but it can be very rewarding.
