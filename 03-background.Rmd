# Background

## The Context

This Benford's Law analysis and demonstration of PPS sampling is performed in the context of a hypothetical audit of [MicroStrategy Incorporated](https://www.microstrategy.com/) (ticker: [MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR?.tsrc=fin-srch)). At the time this scenario was written, the value of MSTR's [Bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD) holdings – see "Digital Assets" in the balance sheet excerpt below – was higher than MSTR's market capitalization.

In other words, MSTR is basically nothing but Bitcoin. Hence, if Bitcoin is bogus, so is MSTR. Interesting situation for an auditor. No?

Here's the game: Assume that you have been retained by MSTR's auditor, KPMG, to assist their front-end audit risk assessment in preparation for auditing MSTR's financial statements for the year ended 12-31-2023.

KPMG wants you to do a high-level reality check -- using Benford's Law -- on publicly available Bitcoin data. Do the available Bitcoin data suggest a genuine data-generating process? In other words, is the Bitcoin market real, or fake? Here's a link to the data on Kaggle. You'll need a free Kaggle account to download it.

Assume, hypothetically, that these data cover the 2014-2023 interval. Thus, for purposes of the exercise, the 2021 Bitcoin data are from 2023. Using this data, create an R Notebook (.rmd format) structured around the Five Basic Steps outlined in Exhibit 2-1 of the AICPA Guide to Audit Data Analytics (ADAs) to perform the analysis and report the results. Here is a summary of the five basic steps:

1.  Plan the ADA

2.  Access and prepare the data

3.  Consider the relevance and reliability of the data

4.  Perform the ADA

5.  Evaluate the results and conclude

## R & R Studio

In automotive terms, you can think of R and its "packages" as an analytical engine and drive train. R Studio is the dashboard and steering wheel – technically called an "integrated development environment" or "IDE" – that keeps data, R packages, scripts, and output visible, organized, moving forward, and instantly accessible to the auditor or data analyst.

I am typing these words into an [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (.Rmd) file that I view or "monitor" in R Studio. Each chapter of the book is contained in a separate .Rmd file. The chapters are collated and rendered in .html, .pdf and other formats as a book using a package called [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). I use [Github](https://github.com/kschulzke/AICPA-Power-Play) for version control. I control all of these activities through the R Studio IDE.

R and R Studio can be accessed through a free or low-cost account at [Posit.Cloud](https://posit.cloud/). Alternatively, they can be [locally installed on a laptop](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). Consistent with its open-source roots, R is operating-system agnostic, working equally well on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. It's not currently feasible to use R Studio on a smartphone. Too much analytical power for such an "itty bitty living space"!

## Resources

The R ecosystem is broad, deep and mostly open-source. R democratizes data analysis, making sophisticated tools and techniques available to smaller colleges and universities, smaller firms, and even solo practitioners.

For those wanting to learn R, learning resources are plentiful and inexpensive. The barriers to entry are low. Excellent open-source online books for learning and using R include [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), [Hands-on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)., [YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/), [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis 3e](https://ggplot2-book.org/preface-3e), and [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/).

Digging into specialized territory, there's [Forecasting: Principles and Practice 3e](https://otexts.com/fpp3/), [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), [Beyond Multiple Linear Regression](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/), [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/), and [Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/). See other titles at [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

Other assists include [Posit.Cloud Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) and Jenny Bryan's [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/index.html) (*Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R*).

## R versus Python

Much ink has been spilled [comparing R and Python](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-r). While this is not the place for a detailed treatment, it's fair to say that R currently beats Python for [visualization](https://r-graph-gallery.com/), statistics, and geocomputation. The two platforms [run a close race](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-chatgpt-to-translate-r-code-to-python-effed461037e) in data transformation, wrangling, and SQL-like powers. For web scraping, [Python shines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-web-scraping-tutorial/).

Python -- [like Java](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/python-vs-java/) -- is a general-purpose programming language, while [R is a domain-specific language or DSL](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-r). Python is much easier to learn (and more popular) than Java but doesn't run as fast. My view is that R is easier than Python for beginners to get up and running and is overall easier to learn. But it's not a bad idea -- though certainly not required -- to know lots of either R or Python and at least a little of the other. Much depends on what you want to do. For accounting professionals, I favor R because of its elegant visualizations, sophisticated statistics tools, and relative ease in set up and maintenance.

## Libraries or Packages

Think of libraries (a.k.a. packages) as apps that extend the capabilities of the base R platform. Packages like [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/), and benford.analysis are to R what Word and Excel are to Microsoft Office, except that R packages are open source. Packages perform a myriad tasks, from data wrangling and text mining, to times series analysis and forecasting, to cluster analysis, linear regression, geocomputation, and elegant visualization, as well as management and publication of team-based analytical projects. All of these packages come with extensive documentation and the most frequently used offer comprehensive [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/).

## Data

The primary data set used in this book is the [Bitcoin Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) dataset housed at Kaggle. Here's what the data contributor says about this data:

> CSV files for select bitcoin exchanges for the time period of Jan 2012 to December March 2021, with minute to minute updates of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), Volume in BTC and indicated currency, and weighted bitcoin price. **Timestamps are in Unix time. Timestamps without any trades or activity have their data fields filled with NaNs.** If a timestamp is missing, or if there are jumps, this may be because the exchange (or its API) was down, the exchange (or its API) did not exist, or some other unforeseen technical error in data reporting or gathering. All effort has been made to deduplicate entries and verify the contents are correct and complete to the best of my ability, but obviously trust at your own risk.

In other words, we would be wise to thoroughly test the data before relying on it for audit-related decisions.
